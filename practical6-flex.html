                <h3>My hero academy</h3>
                <p>May 3, 2024 | Shonen</p>
                <p>My Hero Academia has become one of the most popular and well-known senen around the world in recent years. The story of a boy going to his dream, and even with a seasoning in the form of superheroes and high-quality action, has gained a huge audience. The anime itself is based on a manga currently in ongoing, as is the adaptation itself.
                    The sequel to My Hero Academia started on May 4, 2024. The manga has moved on, and there should already be enough material for one more part. It will most likely be the last, as the original entered the final arc, which began with Chapter 307...</p>

                <p>May 2, 2024 | Fantastic, detective</p>
                <p>The protagonists of the Chinese Donghua, Cheng Xiaoshi and Lu Guang, work in a photo studio, where a very unusual service is provided for the extraction of information. With the help of a photograph, two friends can be transported to the moment captured in it for 12 hours, but they must not change anything in the past. 
                The intermediary is Lin Qiao, their friend. At a certain point, the guys change the events of the past, which triggers a chain of tragic and terrible events. At the end of the first season, Lu Guang is injured by Lin Qiao, who is under the control of the main culprit of all the deaths. Tentatively, the new season should be expected in 2025, since there was a break of 2 years between the first and the second and, most likely, there will be such a gap again before the 3rd part...</p>

                <h3>Magic battle</h3>
                <p>April 30, 2024 | Fantastic, shonen</p>
                <p>The plot revolves around Yuji Itadori, an ordinary Japanese schoolboy who unknowingly swallowed the finger of the King of Curses and became his vessel. After this incident, the boy was supposed to be executed, but Satoru Gojo offered another option, and now the unfortunate boy needs to find and absorb Sukuna's remaining fingers so that his final destruction will later be possible. The protagonist enters the Tokyo College of Magic, where he finds new allies and faces his first enemies.
                It's already safe to say if there will be a season 3 of Magic Battle or not, as the MAPPA announced a season 3 right after the finale, where Culling Game will be adapted, but the details have not yet been announced. Tentatively, the release should be expected in 2025.</p>
